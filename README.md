This project is intended to be a prototype for the action button flex PCB found in the LCD model of the Valve Steamdeck. Important information below. Some may be redundant. 

1). This is only compatible with the LCD version of the steam deck. It will not fit the OLED model. 
2). There is a user_eco layer in the files. This must be renamed to fit your fabrication house of choices specifications to become a stiffener layer so it properly mounts into the flip connector on the main board. 
3). THIS MUST BE ORDERED AS A FLEX PCB.
